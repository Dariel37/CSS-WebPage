            <h3>Programing</h3>
            <p>I've started programing 5 years ago in University, I've worked ON MySQL Database and on webpage development
               using Html, Css, Javascript, and bootstrap, not only webpages. I had the oportunity to use C and C++ for arduino to
               experiment with a water lever detection sensor, Leds, and UNO R3, Microships, Servo, sensors and circuits (Robotics). I also
               used visual basic on few of my first's attemps in programing. I love video Games therefor I couldnt help to gain the
               knowledge on knowing how they work behind the screens. I have a minor in Game Desing and development
               allowing me to work in different Game Engines Like Unity Engine where I learn the software function and
               implementing C# language to make my simple games to work and Unreal Engine implementing C++.</p>

            <h3>Design & Developer</h3>
            <p>I have gain another skill through out the years and is to learn to use different design program for my
               personal use and my games and for my minor. I worked on Adobe programs like Illustraitor, Photoshop,
               Animete. I also have created my own 3D objects using a program called Blender and painted it using Adobe
               Substance for 3D texturing. All for the purpose of increasing my knowledge and habilities in designing </p>
